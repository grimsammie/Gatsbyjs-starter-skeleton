## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone Gatsbyjs Starter Skeleton Repository.**

    Use the CLI to clone, specifying the gatsbyjs skeleton starter.

    ```sh
    # Clone Gatsbyjs Starter skeleton
    https://github.com/shal0mdave/Gatsbyjs-starter-skeleton.git
    ```

1.  **Install packages.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd Gatsbyjs-starter-skeleton/
    npm install
    ```
    <b>Or</b>
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd Gatsbyjs-starter-skeleton/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in the Gatsby starter skeleton project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    |   ├─ assets
    |   ├─ components
    |   ├─ hoc
    |   ├─ pages
    |   ├─ utils
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

    2.1. **`assets`**: This directory contains all the static assets of the project like images, local fonts, lightweight videos, css and even javascript files go here.

    2.2. **`components`**: This directory contains all the react components; both the ones that are speccific to a single page and the ones that can be used globally on all the pages on the site.

    2.3. **`hoc`**: This directory contains all the higher order react components that you may wish to wrap other components of your applicatiion around. It contains an <b>Auxiliary</b> component built by me to bypass using empty div tags to wrap your components as this may sometimes affect your application's styling.

    2.4. **`pages`**: This directory contains all page components that are rendered to the browser and the 404 component in case the user hits a bad or nonexistent route.

    2.5. **`utils`**: This directory contains all the little chunks of code that are reused throughout the pages components like layout file and Sass variable file.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
